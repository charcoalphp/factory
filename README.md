Charcoal Factory
================

Factories **create** (or build) dynamic PHP objects. Factories can resolve a _type_ to a FQN and create instance of this class with an optional given set of arguments, while ensuring a default base class.

# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-factory_ is with **composer**:

```shell
â˜… composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-factory
```

## Dependencies

-   [`PHP 5.5+`](http://php.net)
    -   Older versions of PHP are deprecated, therefore not supported for charcoal-factory.

> ðŸ‘‰ Development dependencies, which are optional when using charcoal-factory, are described in the [Development](#development) section of this README file.


# Factories

## Usage

Factories have only one purpose: to **create** / instanciate new PHP objects. Factory options should be set directly from the constructor:

```php
$factory = new \Charcoal\Factory\GenericFactory([
    // Ensure the created object is a Charcoal Model
    'base_class' => '\Charcoal\Model\ModelInterface',

    // An associative array of class map (aliases)
    'map' => [
        'foo' => '\My\Foo',
        'bar' => '\My\Bar'
    ],

    // Constructor arguments
    'arguments' => [
        $dep1,
        $dep2
    ],

    // Object callback
    'callback' => function (&obj) {
        $obj->do('foo');
    }
]);

// Create a "\My\Custom\Baz" object with the given arguments + callbck
$factory->create('\My\Custom\Baz');

// Create a "\My\Foo" object (using the map of aliases)
$factory->create('foo');

// Create a "\My\Custom\FooBar" object with the default resolver
$factory->create('my/custom/foo-bar');
```

Constructor options (class dependencies) are:

| Name               | Type       | Default    | Description                            |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `base_class`       | _string_   | `''`   | Optional. A base class (or interface) to ensure a type of object.
| `default_class`    | _string_   | `''`   | Optional. A default class, as fallback when the requested object is not resolvable.
| `arguments`        | _array_    | `[]`   | Optional. Constructor arguments that will be passed along to created instances.
| `callback`         | _Callable_ | `null` | Optional. A callback function that will be called upon object creation.
| `resolver`         | _Callable_ | `null`<sup>[1]</sup> | Optional. A class resolver. If none is provided, a default will be used.
| `resolver_options` | _array_    | `null` | Optional. Resolver options (prefix, suffix, capitals and replacements). This is ignored / unused if `resolver` is provided.

<small>[1] If no resolver is provided, a default `\Charcoal\Factory\GenericResolver` will be used.</small>

## The resolver

The _type_ (class identifier) sent to the `create()` method can be parsed / resolved with a custom `Callable` resolver.

If no `resolver` is passed to the constructor, a default `\Charcoal\Factory\GenericResolver` is used. This default resolver transforms, for example, `my/custom/foo-bar` into `\My\Custom\FooBar`.

## Class map / aliases

Class _aliases_ can be added by setting them in the Factory constructor:

```php
$factory = new GenericFactory([
    'map' => [
        'foo' => '\My\Foo',
        'bar' => '\My\Bar'
    ]
]);

// Create a `\My\Foo` instance
$obj = $factory->create('foo');
```

## Ensuring a type of object

Ensuring a type of object can be done by setting the `base_class` property.

The recommended way of setting the base class is by setting it in the constructor:

```php
$factory = new GenericFactory([
    'base_class' => '\My\Foo\BaseClassInterface'
]);
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Note that _Interfaces_ can also be used as a factory's base class.

## Setting a default type of object

It is possible to set a default type of object (default class) by setting the `default_class` property.

The recommended way of setting the default class is by setting it in the constructor:

```php
$factory = new GenericFactory([
    'default_class' => '\My\Foo\DefaultClassInterface'
]);
```

> âš  Setting a default class name changes the standard Factory behavior. When an invalid class name is used, instead of throwing an `Exception`, an object of the default class type will **always** be returned.

## Constructor arguments

It is possible to set "automatic" constructor arguments that will be passed to every created object.

The recommended way of setting constructor arguments is by passing an array of arguments to the constructor:

```php
$factory = new GenericFactory([
    'arguments' => [
        [
            'logger' => $container['logger']
        ],
        $secondArgument
    ]
]);
```

## Executing an object callback

It is possible to execute an object callback upon object instanciation. A callback is any `Callable` that takes the newly created object by reference as its function parameter.

```php
// $obj is the newly created object
function callback(&$obj);
```

The recommended way of adding an object callback is by passing a `Callable` to the constructor:

```php
$factory = new GenericFactory([
    'arguments' => [[
        'logger' => $container['logger']
    ]],
    'callback' => function (&$obj) {
        $obj->foo('bar');
        $obj->logger->debug('Objet instanciated from factory.');
    }
]);
```


# Development

To install the development environment:

```shell
â˜… composer install --prefer-source
```

To run the scripts (phplint, phpcs and phpunit):

```shell
â˜… composer test
```

## Development dependencies

-   `phpunit/phpunit`
-   `squizlabs/php_codesniffer`
-   `satooshi/php-coveralls`

## Coding Style

All Charcoal modules follow the same coding style and `charcoal-factory` is no exception. For PHP:

-   [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
-   [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
-   [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_
-   [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/)
-   Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details on code style.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
